    # 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A regression-based machine learning project that predicts house prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Real estate buyers often struggle with estimating the fair value of a property. This project aims to build a predictive model that can forecast house prices based on structured housing data, helping users make informed decisions.

---

## 💼 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the housing dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns
- Apply feature engineering techniques
- Build a regression model using machine learning
- Evaluate model performance
- Create a Streamlit app for user interaction

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and missing values
   - Converted categorical features into numerical formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Distribution plots
   - Outlier detection

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - One-hot encoding
   - Normalization
   - Handling skewed distributions

4. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge and Lasso for regularization
   - Model tuning using GridSearchCV

5. **Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Cross-validation
